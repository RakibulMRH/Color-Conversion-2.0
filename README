1. Enter key for feature no. 6
2. Put resolution value in this format (underscore means a space) => Width_Height
3. Put the pixel location (To get the pixel location simply open the image using windows paint app then point the cursor to it and notice the position down below that changes if coursor moves over the image).
4. After enter the pixel location keeping spaces in between of its width and height you should get the exact vertices by now.
Hope you understand!
