## Usage Guide

### 1. Feature No. 6 Key
To access Feature No. 6, you will need to enter the corresponding key.

### 2. Resolution Format
When specifying the resolution, use this format (underscore represents a space): Width_Height

### 3. Obtaining Pixel Locations
To obtain pixel locations, follow these steps:
- Open the image using the Windows Paint app.
- Hover the cursor over the image.
- Observe the position displayed at the bottom as the cursor moves over the image.

### 4. Finding Exact Vertices
After entering the pixel location, ensure there are spaces between the width and height values. This will allow you to determine the exact vertices.
